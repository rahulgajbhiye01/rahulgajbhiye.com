# Welcome to MDX Blogging

This is a **sample blog post** written in MDX. You can use all the power of Markdown combined with React components!

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your Markdown content. You can import components, export metadata, and write JSX directly in your markup.

```javascript
function BlogPost() {
  return <h1>Hello from JSX!</h1>;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  This is an info callout. Perfect for highlighting important information!
</Callout>

## Code Examples

Here's some JavaScript with syntax highlighting:

```javascript filename="example.js" showLineNumbers
const greeting = "Hello, World!";

function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(sayHello("MDX"));
```

And here's some CSS:

```css filename="styles.css"
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #007acc, #0099ff);
  border: none;
  border-radius: 8px;
  color: white;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

  Always include meaningful examples in your blog posts to help readers
  understand the concepts better!
